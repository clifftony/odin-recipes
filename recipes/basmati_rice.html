        <h3 class="header2">Steps for the preparation of Basmati Rice and stuffed </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring water and brown rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, 
                and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>
                Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, and parsley; cook for 
                2 minutes. Add ground turkey, salt, and garlic power. Cook and stir using a 
                wooden spoon until meat is no longer pink and slightly browned, about 5 minutes. 
                Add tomato sauce and 1/2 cup chicken broth. Simmer over low heat for 5 minutes. 
                Add cooked rice and stir stuffing well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill each bell pepper half with stuffing and arrange neatly in a 9x13-inch baking 
                dish. Cover each pepper with a handful of shredded Cheddar cheese. Pour remaining 
                chicken broth into the bottom of the baking dish and cover tightly with aluminum foil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove foil and bake until cheese is 
                browned, about 5 minutes more. Serve right away.
